# The Seneca Library Application 

This console-menu application receives books and other publications and stores them into the library system with the information needed for their retrieval. 
Later, each publication can be lent out to members of the library with a due date for return. Codebase was improved gradually to meet milestone-specific requirements. 
The whole system was built based on the Object-Oriented Programming paradigm and inclusive of the following:
- Polymorphism: Dynamic Dispatch, Method and Operator Overloading, Templates, Interfaces, Virtual Functions
- Inheritance: Derived Classes with Resources
- Encapsulation: this Object, Classes and Resources, Member Operators and Functions, I/O Operators
- Dynamic Memory Allocation (Destruction)
- File Handling
- Input and Output Refinements
